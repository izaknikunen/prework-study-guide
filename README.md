# prework-study-guide

## Description

I made this webpage as a study guide for Northwestern's coding bootcamp. This specifically was built as a place to bring together all the knowledge learned in the bootcamp's prework. It makes it easy to find all the quick reference information you need in one place. I learned how to combine all the elements of CSS HTML and Javascript and Git to create a webpage.
